# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of liver disease based on medical attributes using machine learning techniques. <br>
The model is trained and evaluated using a structured dataset and provides insights into factors influencing liver health.
<br>
## Features

1.) Data preprocessing and feature analysis<br>
2.) Machine Learning model for liver disease classification<br>
3.) Model evaluation with accuracy and performance metrics<br>
4.) Easy-to-understand implementation using Jupyter Notebook<br>
5.) Helps in early detection and prevention of liver disorders<br>

## Tech Stack

Language: Python <br>
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy — Data processing matplotlib, seaborn — Visualization
scikit-learn — Machine learning model building
<br>Jupyter Notebook — Interactive development
