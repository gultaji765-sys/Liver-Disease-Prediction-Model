# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of liver disease based on medical attributes using machine learning techniques. <br>
The model is trained and evaluated using a structured dataset and provides insights into factors influencing liver health.
<br>
## Features

1.) Data preprocessing and feature analysis<br>
2.) Machine Learning model for liver disease classification<br>
3.) Model evaluation with accuracy and performance metrics<br>
4.) Easy-to-understand implementation using Jupyter Notebook<br>
5.) Helps in early detection and prevention of liver disorders<br>

## Tech Stack

Language: Python <br>
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy — Data processing matplotlib, seaborn — Visualization
scikit-learn — Machine learning model building
<br>Jupyter Notebook — Interactive development

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from Kaggle as a .csv file and it contains medical parameters such as:
Age<br>
Gender<br>
Total Bilirubin<br>
Alkaline Phosphatase<br>
Alamine Aminotransferase (ALT)<br>
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)<br>
Albumin<br>
Albumin/Globulin Ratio<br>
The dataset is used to predict whether a patient has liver disease or not (binary classification).<br>

## Result 
Model achieved accuracy of 58% with a strong recall of 0.78 for positive cases in predicting liver disease.<br>
Visualization and correlation analysis reveal key health factors.<br>
